# Listings_Kaggle_Competition

In this challenge we had to create Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and PCA classes, similar to the ones provided by Sci-Kit Learn.

Next, by creating an original flow and preprocess, had to get the best results in classifying listings in Japan (Kaggle competitions) based on a binary target - "expensive".

In the following code and paper you can see a full description of the code, the preprocess, the different features and methods implemented.

On the final test (private test) this flow was given an AUC-ROC score of [to be completed], 2 place out of ~50 teams.

##### Code will be published once the competition is closed. Stay tuned for more!
